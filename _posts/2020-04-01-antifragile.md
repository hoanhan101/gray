- Fragile things are exposed to volatility, robust things resist it, antifragile things benefit from it
- The antifragile system is made up of fragile parts
  - The weak one dies in the process while the strong one stays
  - Individual failure can provide helpful information to strengthen the system as a whole
- Shock and stressors strengthen antifragile system by forcing them to build up capacity
  - When human bounce back after traumatic accidents, hardships or failures, they become stronger
  - Lifting heavy puts body to unusual stress and makes muscle stronger
  - Even though The Titanic was a disaster, it made the ship cruising system stronger
- Trying to over-control systems often leads to fragility
  - Mom who overprotects her children prevents them from developing the ability to bounce back and adapt to future difficulties
- To take the advantage of antifragility, you don't need to understand the opportunities you see, just when to seize them
  - Society put too much value on theoretical or academic knowledge and not too much on practical one
  - Often the most successful traders don't know complicated economic theory or finance; they know when to buy and sell
  - The Industrial Revolution was not instigated by academics but hobbyists
- The shorter the time frame you observe an even, the higher the noise you will perceive
- Prediction in the modern world is impossible
  - You can't predict the future based on the past
  - An assumption that the worst event we have witnessed must be the worst that could ever happen is simply false
  - What’s most likely to stick in the future is what has already been around for long
  - Instead of trying to predict what is going to happen, position yourself in such a way that you have optionality
    - The more options you have, the more ways you have to respond to unforeseen events (but not too many options)
    - Prepare for failure scenarios
- Squeeze is a situation where you have no choice but to do it, regardless of the cost
  - They are opposite of options
  - The larger something is, the harder the squeeze, the more damage it causes
  - Still, the larger something is, the harder it will be hit by unexpected events
- The Barbell Strategy suggests to play it safe on one side so that you can take more risks on other side
  - Cover your downside to protect yourself from extreme harm
  - Let the upside take care of itself
    - If the risky part plays out badly, you’re still fine
    - If a Black Swan event makes the risks pay off big, you profit handsomely
- Practical activities
  - Lift heavy weights or do HIIT
  - Practice intermittent fasting
  - Eat fermented foods, such as sauerkraut, kimchi, yogurt, pickles,...
  - Cold/heat exposure
    - Take cold showers, ice baths, wear less clothes and sleep only with your sheets
    - Take saunas, do Bikram yoga and get a sweat on during training
  - Put most of your money in safe investments and 10% in highly lucrative ones
  - Keep your day job but take massive action on your side hustle at night
