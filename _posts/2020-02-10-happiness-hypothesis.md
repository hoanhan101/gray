- Happiness (H) = S (Biological happiness set point) + C (Life conditions) + V (Voluntary activities).
  - Each person has a characteristic level of happiness that each is born with.
  - It's not a set point but a range.
  - The challenge is to understand C and V in order to push H to the top of the range.
- The 2 biggest parts of C are love and pursuing the right goals.
  - We are social creatures in a sense that we can't be happy without having friends and secure attachments. To love well is to have good relationships with other people.
  - [The right goals are ones that produce states of flow and engagement.](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66354.Flow)
  - Once basic needs are met, money cannot buy additional happiness.
    - According to the adaptation principle, we're likely to adapt to what we set for ourselves. Luxuries and other goods adapt completely while some other "purchases" are less subject to:
      - Spending more time with friends and family.
      - Reducing commuting time even if it means living in smaller houses.
      - Taking longer vacations even if it means earning less.

- V are things that we choose to do, not that we have to, such as meditation, exercise, learning new things and so on.
  - We can increase our happiness if we use your strengths, particularly in the service of strengthening connections such as helping friends, expressing gratitude to benefactors.
  - According to the progress principle, pleasure comes more from making progress toward a goal than from achieving them. That said, we should take the initiative and perform gratifying activities regularly.
