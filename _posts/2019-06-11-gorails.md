  Got tired of trading my time for money then decided to document Rails practices
  and turned them into a product.

  questions publicly.

- Generated thousand visitors the first month by documenting some free guides
  on the blog, then decided to keep going because there was need.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Took 5 month to plan, record, edit screencasts for the first 2 courses.
- Setup Stripe and Wistia himself.

  subscribers the second day.
