Hi friends,

4 months ago, I made a [reddit
post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/ctyvbc/is_anyone_interested_in_weekly_coding_interview/)
on creating a newsletter that sends out 3-6 coding interview problems with details
solutions every week. To my surprise, the post received a lot of attention and
positive feedback from the community.

**Since the total number of problems and solutions has just passed 101, I would
like to say another big thank you all again for all the support. It really
helps me keep going.**

Moving on, I am hoping to add more questions and then finally condense them into a list of
most frequently appeared coding interview problems that I think are the most
valuable and productive to spend time on. Again, my goal has always been to
help you get good at algorithms and data structures so that you can prepare better
for your next coding interviews.

For those who don't know, [here is the link to all 101+ questions and solutions, sorted by
resources →](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo)

Best,
