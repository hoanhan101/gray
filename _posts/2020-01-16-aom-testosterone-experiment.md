- How testosterone is made:
  - Sub-types of testosterone:
    - Free: purest form with no protein attached, has the most benefits though only makes up 2-3% of our total testosterone
    - SHBG-bound: help regulating the amount of free testosterone, biologically inactive (our bodies can’t use this type of testosterone to help build muscles or boost our mood), makes up 40-50% of our total testosterone
    - Albumin-bound: stabilize extra-cellular fluid volumes, also biologically inactive though can be easily broken in order to create free testosterone when needed
  - A small percentage of testosterone is made in the adrenal glands on top of our kidneys, but 95% of it is made in our testicles.
- Testosterone deficiency downsides:
  - Men suffering from depression typically have low T level.
  - As the T level decreases, the body's ability to regulate insulin decreases, causes fat to accumulate, put one at higher risk for type 2 diabetes.
  - Low libido and erectile dysfunction are two of the first signs of low testosterone.
  - Low testosterone levels to an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease as well as the cognitive ability issues (memory loss, trouble concentrating, fogginess).
- The keys to increasing testosterone level naturally are eating better, exercising smarter, and getting more sleep.
  - Eat more high-fat foods.
    - Higher fat and cholesterol consumption results in increased levels of total T.
    - High protein and low carb could cause the T level to decrease.
    - Broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage remove estrogens that lower our T.
    - Author's diet (40% carb, 30% protein, 30% fats):
      - Breakfast: three slices of bacon and three whole eggs
      - Lunch: salad mix: meat (the fattier the better), Brazil nuts/walnuts, avocados/olives, spinach, broccoli
      - Dinner: whatever though try to get as much as carb from veggie and fruit
  - If you want to take supplements, consider vitamin D3 and omega3 fish oil, though they only help a bit.
  - Exercise regularly.
    - Strength training: Starting Strength, 5/3/1 program.
    - HIIT training.
    - Don't overtrain (3-4 times a week is good), move more instead.
  - Get better sleep.
    - If you don’t have "morning wood" on a consistent basis, you might have low T.
    - If you’re not getting enough quality sleep, your body can’t produce testosterone as efficiently or effectively.
    - Try to get 8 to 9 hours of sleep consistently.
  - Manage stress.
    - Go for long walk.
    - Practice deep breathing exercise.
  - Avoid xenoestrogens chemicals by using organic products.
  - Have more sex.
  - Take cold bath.
