- Concentrate:
  - Do one thing at a time.
    - Exceptional work is always associated with periods of deep concentration.
  - Have a clear purpose on what you want to learn about.
    - What does it matter?
    - How is it applicable to my life? How can I apply it?
    - How can it help me achieve my goals?
- Create and connect:
  - People that learn quickly or have a so-called photographic memory apply their creativity to everything they learn, using the SEE principles.
    - S-Senses: the more senses you engage, the more lively the images become, the more memorable they are
    - E-Exaggeration: exaggerate with humor, make the images illogical, make the learning more fun and easy to memorize
    - E-Energize: give images action, make a movie, like how Disney does with their objects
  - A tip to remember abstract concepts or complex words is to rhyme or break it own to more meaningful concepts. For examples:
    - Tiger in Spanish is Tigre, which sounds like tea grey: imagine a tiger drinking grey tea
    - The capital of Greece is Athens, which sounds like eight hens: imagine them swimming in Greece
  - Long-term memory can be used to trap short-term information.
    - The car method: use your car image (long-term) and store new information on parts of the car (short-term)
    - The body method: use parts of your body to store new information
    - The peg method: use rhyming words to store ordered lists (one-bu, two-shoe, three-tree, four-door, five-hive, six-stick, seven-heaven, eight-gate, nine-vine, ten-hen)
  - Linking thoughts, associating concepts, developing a story line are great ways to create a relationship between the known and unknown and strengthen the memory capacity.
    - Recall, reinforce, compare different features of what you have already known to what you don't know
- Continuous use:
  - Have self-discipline to stick the practice/review sessions.
    - Again, have a strong vision and a clear purpose on what you want.
    - Make it part of your DAILY routine.
    - Stop listening to your feelings, just do it whether you feel like it or not.
