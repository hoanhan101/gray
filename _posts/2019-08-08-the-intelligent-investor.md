- Focus on long-term value.
  - Don't fall into the trap of only looking at short-term gains or risky investments in companies that are trending.
  - It's easy for human to trick themselves into seeing a pattern when there's actually just randomness.
  - Instead, look at the big picture of the company's financial history, its current value and future potential.
- Diversify investments.
  - Never put money on one stock, no matter how promising it appears.
  - Invest in both bonds and common stocks.
  - Buy in low and sell in high.
  - Align your portfolio with well-established funds with a long history of success.
  - Set your investments on autopilot.
- Aim for safe and steady revenue, not to pull in extraordinary profits and outperform professional brokers.
  - Reflect and readjust your portfolio every six months.
- Always be prepared for crises.
  - Don't sell everything at the first sign of danger.
  - Even after the most harmful crashes, the market will recover.
- Don't trust the market.
  - It swings back and froth between ups and down.
  - Fluctuations can't be foreseen.
  - Crises happen from time to time.
