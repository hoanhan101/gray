### What is the product?

Email marketing tool for bloggers and content creators.

### What is its current revenue?

5k to $600k a month in 2 years.

### What is the business model?

Subscription.

### How did the founder come up with the idea?

- Nathan used to design and write books on iOS and web app.
- Was expert on email marketing and had built and grew his personal audience
  throughout the year.
- One day he blogged about starting a SaaS company but had no idea to work on.
  Just basically set a public goal to hold accountability.
- Came up with an idea to interview businesses in depth, tried to see what
  problems they were facing. But then decided to stay true to his problems -
  building a service that was better than Mailchimp.

### How did they know it was the right one?

- Bunch of similar products were out there and had huge market shares.
  Still went for it because it showed there were needs and still rooms for
  improvements.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Knew about 10 people who were good at email marketing. Asked them about their
  frustrations, tried to understand their why, asked if they would pay for a solution.
- Came back after a month with a MVP and asked to buy it - started to get real
  feedbacks, though only made 1 purchase though they all said yes.

### How did they get their first paying customers?

- Through direct contact as above.
- Also launch pre-sale programs.
