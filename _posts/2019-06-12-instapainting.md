### How did the founder come up with their idea?

- Raised money from YC after YC, spent about 2 years pivoting and trying
  different ideas. Focused on how to generate revenue immediately because he

  subreddit.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Found one supplier that could do the work.
- The very first artists were his roommates.
- Had a basic interface for artist to check the order and manually brokered and
  managed transaction. Had to email back and forth because there was no

- Barely managed to ship on time so even had to do the painting himself.
- Replied to email in timely fashion. Took great care of customers.

### How did they get their first paying customers?

- Tried to sell on r/startups subreddit, targeting gifts around New Year time.
- 3 months later got a TechCrunch article, then Hacker News.
- Optimized for SEO.
- Did some cool content marketing strategies such as: making a robot to
  replicate artist's painting, making a 2-player version of 2048 and having
  featured on top of Hacker News,...
