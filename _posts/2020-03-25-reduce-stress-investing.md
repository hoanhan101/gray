Paying too much attention to your investments (more than once per quarter) costs more than just your time:
- Make you more risk-averse
  - The shorter the time the returns are generated from, the less risk investors are willing to take
  - You'll see loss 50% of the time if you check performance daily, 25% if one a year, 1% if 7 years
- Mislead about future return
  - Knowing which stocks performed the best last month won't tell you which ones will perform the best this month
  - Even professionals can get caught in this trap
- Increase your risk of performance chasing, which could reduce your returns
  - Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results
  - Performance chasing could cost an investor between 2 to 4% per year
- Make you unhappy
  - We tend to feel losses more powerfully than we feel gains
  - Market losses are the one constant that donâ€™t change over time, meaning you'll see losses most of the time

Next time, think twice before you feel the urge to check on your performance!
