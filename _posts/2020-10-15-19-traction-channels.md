## Viral Marketing

Viral marketing is the process of getting your existing users to refer others to your product.
It can come from different forms:
- Pure word of mouth: people naturally tell people about your product.
- Inherent virality: people can only get value by inviting others (chat app, social media app).
- Collaboration: the product becomes more valuable when used collaboratively (Google Docs).
- Embedded communication from the product (Apple's "Sent from my iPhone").
- Incentive (refer friends to get more space on DropBox).
- Embedded buttons & widgets (Youtube's embedded videos, Facebook's Like button).
- Social networks.

## Public Relations (PR)

PR focus on getting coverage from traditional media like news, newspapers, magazines. Most make
money from ads, meaning the more view they have, the better. So if you have a compelling story,
they want to hear from you.

Top news get stories from smaller news or blogs. That said, to target these effectively, start small
and pitch to niche blogs or ones who often get picked up by larger ones like TechCrunch, Lifehacker,
Hacker News, Reddit, and so on.

Follow influencers in your industry and target blogs they often link to. Ask them for comment/feedback
on your product, and also to share it with their audience if possible.

Figure out specific reporters covering your market and build relationship with them (read their articles,
comment, offer help). Pitch when you have a compelling story (raising money, launching products, hitting
a usage barrier). Refer to the book for pitch templates.

## Unconventional PR

There are two types of unconventional PR:
- Publicly stunt: Richard Branson dressing like a woman, DuckDuckGo's billboard in Google's
backyard highlighting its privacy focus, Dollar Shave Club's viral video.
- Customer appreciation: sending gits, hand-written notes to customers, contests and giveaways,
having amazing customer support.

Unconventional PR is really effective if done right.

## Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

SEM refers to placing advertisements on search engine like Google. You can use SEM to test product
positioning even before you build it.

3 terminologies to focus on are:
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): if 100 people see your ad, 3 of them click, your CTR is 3%.
- Cost per Click (CPC): amount it costs to buy a click.
- Cost per Acquisition (CPA): amount it costs to acquire a customer.

The higher your CTR is, the higher quality your ad is, the better placement and pricing you can have.

If your CPC is $1, 10% of people click on your ad and *make a purchase*, your CPA is
$1/10% = $10. If your product costs $1 and it costs you $10 to acquire a customer, SEM might not worth it.

## Social and Display Ads

Display Ads are ones you see on websites all over the Internet where they are run by ad networks.
- Large Networks: Google Display Network, Advertising.com.
- Niche Networks: BuySell Ads.
- Direct Networks: ask sites owners to place your ads.

To know the ads your competitors are running, use tools like MixRank, Adbeat. To determine whether
a site's audience is the right fit, use tools like Alexa, Quantcast.

Social Ads is when you use social media (LinkedIn, Twitter, Facebook, reddit) to generate interests,
awareness, start a conversation, deliver a message, build an audience rather than conversion purposes
(completing a sale, generating sign-up).

## Offline Ads

There are many kinds of offline ads, such as TV, radio, magazines, newspapers, billboards, direct mail.
The most important factor to consider while making an offline ads purchase is the demographics.

You can run cheap tests by targeting local markets first and scale up to national ones. To track it,
use unique codes or web addresses.

## Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

SEO is the process of improving your ranking in search engines.

[Moz's The Beginner's Guide to SEO](https://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo) is a good start for beginners.

SEO comes down to two things: contents and links.
- The more aligned your content is with the keywords, the better it will rank.
- The more links you can get from credible and varying sources, the better it will rank. This can be achieved
via PR, content marketing, and so on.

## Content Marketing

Blogging is proven to be a great way to promote your product. Having a strong blog can positively impact
other traction channels as well.

Some use their blogs as a marketing platform before they even have a product.
Some use their blogs as their main channel for customers acquisition.

Other than blogging, courses, ebooks, infographics,... are also be used in content marketing.

> “In the early days, it’s unlikely that your blog will see much traffic, regardless of content quality.
> Even Unbounce was receiving less than 800 monthly visits after six months of consistently putting out content.
> It took a while for them to grow to 20,000 monthly visitors.”

One of the best way to grow your audience is to do guest posting on popular blogs.

To succeed, you have to create quality content and **[publish consistently](/james-clear-on-writing-consistently)**.
- Write about problems your target customers have.
- Use data from your product to produce in-depth posts.

## Email Marketing

Email marketing works best when it's personalized as they sit next to email updates from friends and family in your
customer's inbox.

Email can be used in all stages of the customer lifecycle:
- Finding customers: include an email list in your blog, offer materials over email, and so on.
- Engaging customers: what you really want is an email list of **active users**. What it means depends on your product.
For Dropbox, it means uploading at least 1 file. For Twitter, it means sending out a tweet or following at least 5 people.
- Retaining customers: send out lifecycle emails to slowly expose customers to new features, weekly summary,...
- Upselling cusomters.
- Generating referrals.
