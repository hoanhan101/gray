- When it comes to weight loss, the keys are to eat less and exercise more. But instead of focusing on these 2 fundamental things, we discuss trans fat, supplements,...
- It's the same with personal finance. There are only 3 key points:
  - Cut costs
  - Earn more
  - Optimize your existing spending
- Spend consciously:
  - Define your rich life standard.
    - What being rich means to you since it’s different for everyone because we value things differently.
    - What is important and what not.
  - Spend extravagantly on these you value, ruthlessly cut down the cost for everything else. For example:
    - Rather spending money on expensive car and big houses, spend them on experiences with friends and people I love.
    - Can also spend money on different hobbies such as making movies, opening restaurants, universities…
  - 4 major spending buckets:
    - Fixed costs (50-60%): rent, utilities, cell phones, medical insurance, car payment, public transportation, groceries, clothes, internet/cable
    - Investment (10%): 401k, Roth IRA
    - Savings (5-10%): house down payment, vacations, gifts, emergency
    - Guilt-free spending money (20 - 35%): dining out, drinking, movies, clothes, shoes
  - Credit cards are worth having as long as you manage them well.
    - Completely pay off your bill at the end of the money - own nothing, no interests - like free short-term loan but better because of perks and rewards.
    - Large purchases are almost made by credits. If you have a good credit score, the interest rates is low, you can save a lot of money.
    - Increase the credit line every 6-12 months.
- Negotiate a raise:
  - Getting a raise is not about you - nobody cares if your expenses are higher. It’s about demonstrating your value.
  - 3-6 months before your review: become top performer, exceed every expectations
  - 1-2 months before: prepare evidences
  - 1-2 weeks before: practice the conversations
  - It’s important that you regularly communicate your process - update every week or two
- Saving is not enough. Make money works for you.
  - Open a high-interest saving bank account and set up automatic transaction.
  - Invest early.
    - Think about the big picture.
    - Compound interests are huge in the long run.
    - “Compounding is mankind’s greatest invention because it allows for the reliable, systematic accumulation of wealth.” - Albert Einstein
  - Investment isn't about being sexy, aka picking stocks. It’s about making money.
  - Everyday you don’t invest, you actually lose money due to inflation. You will not realize this until you are old. That said, think long-term, start invest early.
    - Take full advantage of 401k by contributing enough to get 100% of the match - this is free money.
    - Contribute as much as possible to Roth IRA (check current limits).
    - If there’s money left over, keep contributing to 401k (check current limits).
    - Then, Health saving account (HSA).
    - Then, Non-retirement investment account.
- 401k vs Roth IRA.
  - 401k
    - Pros:
      - Money is not taxed until you withdraw years later. Have more for compound grow.
      - Employer match - free money
      - Make 60k, contribute 3k, match 5% -> 6k, start at age 25, earn 8%, earn 1.6 mil when you retire.
      - Automatic - don’t have to care about it.
    - Cons:
      - Cause it’s a retirement account. Withdrawing before results in 10% penalty.
      - Have to pay taxes afterward!
      - Burden when switching job.
  - Roth IRA - pay taxes on the amounts you contribute.
  - Conclusion:
    - Both of them are for long-term investment>
    - It’s kind of lock-in because it’s your retirement money but
      - You can withdraw your money you contribute penalty free
      - Access your money in certain cases - hardship distribution.

  - Rich people tend to become more conservative when it comes to investing because 2-3% of millions is a lot already!
  - Stocks has highest risk, brings the best return - 11.5% on average.
  - Bond has lower risk, 5.2%.
