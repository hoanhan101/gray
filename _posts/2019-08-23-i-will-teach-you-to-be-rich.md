How to earn more, save more and live a rich life:
- When it comes to weight loss, the keys are: eat less and exercise more. But instead of focusing on these 2 fundamental things, we discuss trans fat, supplements,... -> same with personal finance.
- There are some key points. No need to be expert to be rich.
  - Cut costs
  - Earn more
  - Optimize your existing spending
- Define your rich life standard. What does being rich mean to YOU? It’s different for everyone because we value things differently
- Spend more on the things you care about.
  - Instead of driving an expensive cars or living in a penthouse, can use money to invest in different hobbies such as making movies, opening restaurants, universities…
  - Travelling and experiencing different cultures
- Credit cards are worth having as long as you manage them well
  - Completely pay off your bill at the end of the money - own nothing, no interests - like free short-term loan but better because of perks and rewards
  - Large purchases are almost made by credits. If you have a good credit score, the interest rates is low, u saves a lot of money
  - Increase the credit line every 6-12 months
- Open a high-interest saving bank account and set up automatic transaction
- Saving is not enough. Need to make money works for you.
- Invest early.
  - Think about the big picture.
  - Compound interests are huge in the long run.
  - “Compounding is mankind’s greatest invention because it allows for the reliable, systematic accumulation of wealth.” - Albert Einstein
- Investment isn't about being sexy - picking stocks. It’s about making money.
- Everyday you don’t invest, you actually lose money due to inflation. You will not realize this until you are old -> think long-term. Start invest early.
  - Take full advantage of 401k by contributing enough to get 100% of the match - this is free money
  - Contribute as much as possible to Roth IRA (check current limits)
  - if there’s money left over, keep contributing to 401k (check current limits)
  - Health saving account (HSA)
  - Non-retirement investment account
- 401k vs Roth IRA
  - 401k
    - Pros
      - Money is not taxed until you withdraw years later. Have more for compound grow.
      - Employer match - free money
      - Make 60k, contribute 3k, match 5% -> 6k, start at age 25, earn 8%, earn 1.6 mil when you retire
      - automatic - don’t have to care about it
    - Cons
      - Cause it’s a retirement account. Withdrawing before results in 10% penalty -> brutal
      - Have to pay taxes afterward!
      - Burden when switching job
  - Roth IRA - pay taxes on the amounts you contribute
  - Conclusion
    - Both of them are for long-term investment
    - It’s kind of lock-in because it’s your retirement money but
      - You can withdraw your money u contribute penalty free
      - Access your money in certain cases - hardship distribution
- Conscious spending
  - Decide what’s important and what not
  - Spend extravagantly on these you value, ruthlessly cut down the cost for everything else
    - Rather spending money on expensive car and big houses, spend them on experiences with friends and people I love
  - 4 major buckets:
    - Fixed costs (50-60%): rent, utilities, cell phones, medical insurance, car payment, public transportation, groceries, clothes, internet/cable
    - Investment (10%): 401k, Roth IRA
    - Savings (5-10%): house down payment, vacations, gifts, emergency
    - Guilt-free spending money (20 - 35%): dining out, drinking, movies, clothes, shoes
- Negotiate a raise
  - Getting a raise is not about you - nobody cares if your expenses are higher. It’s about demonstrating your value
  - 3-6 months before your review: become top performer, exceed every expectations
  - 1-2 months before: prepare evidences
  - 1-2 weeks before: practice the conversations
  - It’s important that u regularly communicate your process - update every week or two
- Investing
  - Rich people tend to become more conservative when it comes to investing because 2-3% of millions is a lot already!
  - Stocks has highest risk, brings the best return - 11.5% on average
  - Bond has lower risk, 5.2%
  - Cash/saving account is the safest, 2-4%
  - The rule of thumb is that: when you’re young, invest aggressively on stocks and bonds
