- Focus on high-leverage activities
  - Leverage = impact produced / time invested
  - 80/20 rule - 80% impact comes from 20% work
  - Focus on not more hours but more value per limited time on the task
  - Increase leverage by
    - Reduce the time it takes to complete the activity (default to half-hour meeting instead of one-hour one, automate manual dev process)
    - Increase the value produced (have a clear agenda beforehand, prioritize tasks based on launch date)
    - Shift to higher-leverage activities (use email instead of in-person discussion, talk to customer)
  - Output can be measured by:
    - Number of projects launched
    - Bug fixes
    - Users acquired
    - Engineers hired
    - Quality
    - Revenue generated
- Understand the power of compound interest
  - Compounding leads to an exponential growth curve
  - The earlier compounding starts, the sooner it hits the exponential growth, the faster you can reap its benefits
  - Small deltas in the interest rate can make massive differences in the long run:
    - Improving by 1% per day makes us 37x better at the end of year
    - Google idea of 20% where engineers spend about 1 day a week on a side project to make the company better results in successful products such as Gmail , Google News, Adsense,…
- Optimize for learning because learning compounds
  - Find fast growing work environment
  - Take advantage of the resources at your work
    - Study code from best engineers
    - Write more code
    - Go through technical, educational material
    - Send code views to the harshest critics
    - Participate in design discussions - don’t wait for invitation
    - Team with senior engineers
  - Invest in other skills too
    - Invest in skills that are in high demand
    - Build strong relationships 
    - Read books 
    - Write to teach
    - Pursue side projects
- Prioritize regularly
  - Track TODO list in a single list
  - Sort the list frequently by asking yourself on a recurring basis:
    - Is there anything else I could be doing that’s higher-leverage
      - Focus on what directly produce value (products shipped, user acquired, business metrics moved, sales made)
      - Focus on the important and non-urgent (planning career goals, building relationships, personal development, improving workflow)
  - Preserve larger blocks of focused time + learn to say no unimportant activities
  - Limit the amount of work in progress + resist the urge to work on too many projects at once
  - Make it a habit
- Iterate quickly to build more and learn faster
  - Invest in time-saving tools
    - Bringing the release time down to several minutes helps the team deploy more frequently, 40-50 times a day - skyrockets growth
    - If it saves you 1 hour a day, it saves 10 people 10 times as much
  - Measure the progress frequently
- Validate early and often
  - A well tested, clean design, scalable product doesn't deliver much value if users don’t engage or customers don’t buy it
  - Bounce ideas off teammates
- Define measurable milestones
