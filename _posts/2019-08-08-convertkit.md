### What is the product?

Email marketing tool for bloggers and content creators.

### What is its current revenue (monthly/yearly)?

5k to $600k a month in 2 years.

### What is the business model?

Subscription.

### How did the founder come up with their idea?

Nathan used to design and write books on iOS and web app.

Was expert on email marketing and had built and grew his personal audience throughout the year.

One day he blogged about starting a SaaS company but had no idea to work on. Just basically set a public goal to hold accountability. Had ideas to interview businesses and identify their problems. But then decided to stay true to his problems - building a service that was better than Mailchimp.

### How did they know it was the right problem to work on?

Bunch of similar products were out there and had huge market shares. Still went for it because it showed there were needs.

Knew about 10 people who were good at email marketing. Asked them about their frustrations, tried to understand their why, asked if they would pay for a solution.

Came back after a month with a MVP and asked to buy it - started to get real feedbacks, though only made 1 purchase though they all said yes.

### How did they achieve product/market fit?

Focused on beginners more than high end accounts but then realized that it was very demanding because beginners churned frequently, asked more questions, took more time, money, effort to support. Then chased after big audience.

### How did they get their first paying customers?

Personal connections and audiences via direct sales.
