Hi friend,

I'm here to tell you that [Motion](/motion) was shut down at 5 P.M. EST today. Thank you so much for your support
over the past months. It means a lot to me.

The reason that I built Motion in the first place was to make it easier for me and you to achieve our goals.
However, after using it myself for the last month and asking people for feedback, I came to the conclusion
that it was not as useful as I thought it would be. Now, there are many features that could make it better
though it's becoming harder and harder for me to support it alone, considering that I do have a 9-5 job and
a family that I need to take care of. That said, even though it's a hard decision to make, I have to make
this trade-off to discontinue Motion.

In the meantime, I'm still writing on this blog. If you have additional questions or concerns, feel free to
contact me here and I'll do my best to help.

Best,

Hoanh
