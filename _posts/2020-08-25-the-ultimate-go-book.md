Hi friends,

Almost a year ago, in August 2019, I shared one of my projects called Ultimate Go on GitHub,
<https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go>, and surprisingly, it got a lot of attention from
the community. Fast forward to August 2020, it now has over 11K stars, 900 folks with the help
of more than 20 contributors.

The project is a collection of my notes while learning Go programming language. Different people
have different learning styles. For me, I learn best by doing and walking through examples.
That said, I take notes carefully, comment directly on the source code to make sure that I
understand every single line of code as I am reading and also be mindful of the theories behind the scene.

As Ultimate Go keeps growing, there’s one issue that keeps coming up. That’s about the format
of the project. Specifically, many people have requested an ebook version where the content
is more streamlined and they can read it at their convenience.

That’s when The Ultimate Go Book is born. For the last 3 months or so, I have spent most of
my free time putting together everything from Ultimate Go into a 200-page book. Other than all
the good stuff from Ultimate Go, two new and better things in this version are:
- Follow-along code input and output.
- Diagrams.

Hope it makes your journey of learning Go a bit easier. And again, thank you all for your support.
I really appreciate it.

**Here's the link for the book: <https://gum.co/bpUYF>.**

Note that I've made it free, though I would really appreciate your support.
Regardless, you will receive the book in 2 different formats: PDF and ePub.

Happy reading!

Best,

Hoanh
