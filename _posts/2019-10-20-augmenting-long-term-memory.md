- Anki like a flashcard app but able to manage the review schedule.
  - If you answer a question correctly, the review time expands.
  - The better you master the material, the less frequent it appears
- Memories are maximally strengthened if tested when we're on the verge of forgetting them.
- Used to learn anything: papers, books, talks, conversations, facts, plans,...
- Have desktop client for entering new card, mobile client for reviewing.
- Read a research paper in an unfamiliar field - AlphaGo paper.
  - Read quickly first, come up with questions that:
    - Identify the most important ideas.
    - Look for basics fact that I could understand easily.
  - Make several passes this way, each time try to get deeper, continue to ask questions.
- Make better use of Anki:
  - Make the question more atomic so I could focus on the hard-to-memory details -> asking good questions is very important.
  - Construct your own decks instead of using shared ones -> constructing a card forces you to think through the questions and its answer.
  - Avoid yes/no questions.
- Procedural vs declarative memory.
  - Procedural (implicit, unconscious, automatic): habits such as walking, talking,...
  - Declarative (explicit): know your phone number, a fact,...
  - Basically, there is a difference between remembering a fact and master a process.
    - Just because you remember a Unix command doesn’t mean you can recognize or apply it in a real-world situation.
    - Remembering is not enough. Need to carry out the process. Solve problem with it. 
- If Anki is so great, why isn't it widely used?
  - People prefer last-minute cramming and believe it produces better results, though many studies show it does not.
  - The act if recalling something while we’re on the verge of forgetting is hard, unless one is strongly motivated.
  - Anki is challenging to use well, easy to use poorly.
- The importance of long-term memory.
  - A study shows that chess grandmaster has higher memory capacity.
    - Beginner see a series of individual pieces.
    - Master see see a “chunk”-combinations of pieces recognized as a unit -> able to reason much easier at a higher level of abstraction (25k-100k).
  - A study shows that the better working memory one has, the higher their IQ and vice versa.
  - Having more chunks memorized in some domain is somewhat like an effective boost to a person's IQ in that domain.
- Distribute practice - why Anki works?
  - Memory decays through time - we will forget things eventually.
  - Retest/recall will slow the decay - meaning it takes longer after subsequent recalls.
