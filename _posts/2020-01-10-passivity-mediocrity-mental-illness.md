Most people spend their time passively consuming.

According to Colin Wilson, too much inactivity, rather than promoting mental health, tends to breed unhappiness and a plethora of psychological problems.

> "When he did not occupy his days with interesting tasks, challenges, and

> him, fog his perceptions, and cause him to become a pessimist of the human
> condition."

Even though Wilson's situation is not applicable to all, the struggle to cultivate
an uncommon virtue or skill, produce work of exceptional worth, do something truly
original and do it well is always worth the effort.

> being human is really all about, and it is alone what justifies the self-love
> that is pride.” (Richard Taylor, Restoring Pride)
