### What is the product?

Efficient custom printing on demand - lower cost, better quality, better
turnaround time.

### What is its current revenue?

$100 millions a year.

### What is the business model?

Manufacture.

### How did the founder come up with their idea?

- Had a friend, Raymond, who sold T-shirt online. He was a high school
  student until he dropped out because he had made $1 millions in revenue.
- He did contracts with a Chinese factory at first, but wanted to improve
  the product quality and used a US factory instead.
- Eric later joined to build their own printing infrastructure to a even
  more automated, cheaper, efficient process.

### How did they know it was the right one?

- The T-shirt space was booming at that time, notably Teespring.
- They were doing alright and wanting to do it better,
  faster, and cheaper with their brand TeepChip.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Built the printing API first.
- Used profits to reinvest into the business then built the software team.
- Every step of the decision was made frugally because they did not have a lot
  of capital.

### How did they get their first paying customers?

- Had people signed up early for the API, a lot from Hacker News. A lot of them
  turned into customers.
