Subscription.

### How did the founder come up with their idea?

- Was doing a lot of consulting work and found one of his biggest
  struggles was getting his non-technical clients to participate with
  the issue tracking, especially with small teams.
- After sharing the ideas around, peopled started expressing interests and
  encouraged him to do something like that.

### How did they know it was the right one?

- It was clear that people showed interests in the beginning and wanted to use
  something like that.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Had a simple Rails MySQL setup, built a billing system himself because Stripe
  was not there yet and Braintree was not so good. Took 11 months in total.

- He kept blogging and sharing.
