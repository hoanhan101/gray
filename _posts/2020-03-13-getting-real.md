The Smarter, Faster, Easier Way to Build a Successful Web Application:
- The starting line
  - Build less: less features, options, people, meetings, promises
  - Solve your problem
    - You know what’s is important and what’s not for the product itself
    - It’s likely people have the same problem so now you have a market too
  - Fund yourself - outside funding is plan B
    - Investors want their money back quickly -> overhead + other complicated things follow
    - Money constraints force you to focus + allow creativity
  - Fix time and budget, flex scope: better to launch great thing, on time, on a budget in small scope than big ones with many holes
  - Pick up an enemy and use it as an motivation to tell better story
  - If your app doesn't excite you, something’s wrong
- Stay lean
  - Simplify + focus
  - Lower the cost of change -> change faster (huge advantage over big company)
  - Start with 3 people: a developer, a designer, and a sweeper who can roam between both world
  - Work with your limited resources. Forget about VC, long release cycles, quick hires,...
  - Stay small and friendly -> get closer to customer
- Priorities
  - What is the app vision? Why does it exit? What makes it different?
  - Don’t get too deep in the details early one. Ship it first and optimize it later
  - don’t waste time on problems you don’t have yet: 
    - Scaling to millions of users? Stop dreaming! Majority of apps are never going to reach that phase. Worry about it later once it’s wildly successful.
    - Make decisions in time
  - Find the right audience
    - Narrow the market
    - Focus on the nice or small group of people who wants the product the most
    - Don’t try to please everyone
  - Make opinionated software, choose side, like every great companies: Google, Apple,...
- Feature selection
  - What is the heart of the app?
    - Forget milestone, TODO lists.
    - Just focus on the essential.
    - Let it gain traction. Then add to that foundation.
  - Focus on what matters, REALLY. Cut off everything else.
  - Learn to say no because you have to do that a lot.
  - For every new feature, you need to
    - Say no
    - Force the feature to provide its value
    - If no, end. If yes, continue
    - Sketch the UI
    - Design the UI
    - Code
    - Test, tweak, repeat
    - Document
    - Market
    - Revisit pricing options, term of service,
    - Launch
  - Build something that you can manage, organizationally, strategically, financially
  - Don’t worry too much about feature requests. Customers will constantly remind you about that.
  - Ask customer what they don’t want too and simplify it if possible.
- Process
  - Get something real up and running quickly: it’s ok to do less, skip details, take shortcuts
    - Fail fast and learn
    - Avoid unproductive scheduling and action faking (doing bullshit works that feel “productive” that doesn't get you closer to launching)
  - Idea-to-implementation cycle
    - What does the app need to do? What exactly are you going to make?
    - Sketch it out on paper
    - Create mock-up html screens
    - Code
  - Allowing options/preferences for customers is not necessarily helping them.
    - If you make a bad call, they will complain, then you can fix it.
  - Execute. Build momentum. Move on.
  - Test in the wild.
    - Get it out there. Get real results + feedback
    - Instead of having a beta version and a release version, have beta features in side the release one so you can have real data + workflow
    - Break it down into smaller problems and solve it one by one.
- Organization
  - Build a healthy organization
  - Utilize your alone time to get work done
  - Meetings are normally unproductive.
  - Have fewer meetings
  - Only have it with a clear agenda
  - Release something today. Celebrate small victories.
- Staffing
  - Hire less, only when it’s really needed.
  - Working with prospective employees on a real project can give a lot of insights. However, not everyone has time for that.
  - Look at people codes + contribution on open-source projects
  - Go for quick learning generalists over ingrained specialists
  - Go for happy one
  - Hire good writers because they know how to communicate
- Interface
  - Design the interface before you start coding
  - Start from the core page and build outward. Focus on what matters.
  - For each page, consider these 3 states
    - Blank: the screen before data is entered // could insert quick tutorials, help blurbs, examples with mock data…
    - Regular: normal page
    - Error: when shit happens
  - It’s ok to be inconsistent if your design makes more sense that way
  - Every letter matters.
    - Don’t sound like an engineer talking to another engineer
    - Keep it short and sweet
  - Incorporate admin function into public interfaces so you don’t need to manage 2 different versions
- Code
  - Keep it simple. But be mindful about technical debt.
  - Less maintenance and support work
  - Low cost of change
  - Fewer bugs
  - Choose the tools that everyone is happy and productive with
  - Get data into the world via RSS, API,...
- Words
  - Document what is needed but nothing else.
  - Write stories, not details.
    - Don’t get into the technical/design details, just a quick story
    - Treat it as a normal conversation
  - Use real data if possible, not dummy text all the time -> focus on the UX
  - What is your product’s personality type?
- Pricing and signup
  - Give something for free. Let  people experience and see its usefulness.
  - Make signup and cancellation easy
  - Avoid long term contract, signup fee,...
- Promotion
  - Teaser (dropping hints), preview, launch
  - Build a promo site: overview, tour, screenshots, videos, manifesto, case studies, buzz (customers, press reviews,...), forum, pricing and signup, blog,...
  - Blogging can be more effective (and cheaper) than advertising. Could write about advices, tips, tricks, links,...
  - Start collecting emails asap
  - Share your knowledge. Teaching/educating is a great way to market yourself and your product too.
    - Blog (as above)
    - Speak at conferences
    - Conduct workshops
    - Give interviews.
    - Write articles/books
  - Track your online present. Leave comments, thank you notes, response to negative ones thoughtfully
  - Promote upgrade, in-app purchases
  - Pick an short, catchy, memorable name
- Support
  - Feel the pain yourself. Don’t outsource. Learn from it.
  - Use inline help and FAQ instead of giving manual training
  - Just response quickly even if you don’t have a perfect answer (during business hour)
  - Also thank them for their input
  - Be willing to say no
  - Use forum or chat to let customers help each other
  - Be open, honest, transparent (yeah bad news)
- Post launch
  - Issue a major update 30 days after launch
  - Don’t stop blogging: new FAQs, tutorials, news, features, updates, fixes, buzz/pres
  - Prioritize your bugs
  - Wait before the storm, 1-2 days after releasing a new feature and hearing complaints, then take action
  - Know your competitors
  - More mature doesn't mean more complicated, as long as you provide valuable services that’s fine.
  - Be open to new paths and changes in direction
