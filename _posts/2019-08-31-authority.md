- On writing:
  - Most well-known people in the industry share and teach things that they know, either through speaking or writing.
  - To find a topic, ask yourself what people ask you for help with.
  - You don't have to be an expert to teach, though there are ways to establish expertise:
    - Join official-sounding organizations.
    - Talk about top-rated books on your topic.
    - Write for other leading publication.
  - Two main factors decide if your book is successful are:
    - Does it teach a skill that people use to make money so that they can make more than they spend?
    - Do they gather in any online communities that you can reach?
  - Competition shows there is a market, a need.
  - Make consistent progress everyday. Don't break the chain.
  - Self publish so you don't have to depend on any firm.
- Basic marketing:
  - A good way to market your book is to build up your audience by teaching.
  - Before spending months writing, test the demand by creating a landing page and telling people about it.
  - Have 3 good blog posts to demonstrate your expertise if you don't have ones yet.
  - Use email list to build your audience since social media can be distracting.
  - Don't let your list die by simply keep providing valuable content every week or every few weeks.
- Pricing and packaging:
  - Price on 2 main factors: value delivered and your goals.
    - The more value delivered, the higher the price.
    - If your goal is to build a huge audience, a low price makes sense as more copies would be sold (hopefully).
  - Use packages to charge more for more delivered value:
    - Video tutorials
    - Explanation screencasts
    - Interviews
    - Code samples
    - Courses
    - Workshops
- Prepping for launch:
  - Once you have a landing page, stay contact with your subscribers once every week or two.
    - Get them excited about the incoming book.
    - Gradually drip out a sample chapter, the book outline, other quotes...
  - Try to be everywhere on the launch day by writing for other publications.
    - Start building up a relationship slowly by helping them in some ways.
    - Affiliates also work, though be selective since only a few affiliates can sell well.
    - Give free preview copies and ask for feedbacks and testimonials.
- The sale page:
  - Focus on the pain.
    - Talk to your customers and find out exactly what their pains are.
    - Write them in a list and for each one, explain how your methods for overcoming each one.
  - Basic elements:
    - Why should someone care
    - A sample chapter
    - Table of contents
    - Social proof (testimonials, featured projects,...)
    - About the author
    - Listing your packages
    - Purchase options
    - FAQ (file types, refund policy, skill-level expectations)
- E-commerce:
  - Pros of Kindle and iBook:
    - Support multiple platforms out of the box.
    - Getting setup is easy.
    - Indexed and searchable via popular search engines
  - Cons:
    - Pricing cut
    - Control of subscribers
  - Good alternatives include GumRoad, E-junkie, Space Box.
- Launch day and beyond:
  - Make sure your subscribers are clear about the launch date the day before.
  - Make it easy to share by including sample tweets.
  - Make sure your scheduled guest posts go live today.
  - When sales drop, keep teaching and giving content away for free.
