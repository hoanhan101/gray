### What is the product?

Subscription analytics and insights.

### What is its current revenue?

$14k/month after 6 months, $70K/month in 2017, $120k/month now.

### What is the business model?

Subscription.

### How did the founder come up with their idea?

- Was running 2 other SaaS products in the survey space and needed these
  numbers himself: monthly recurring revenue, lifetime value, churn,... There
  was no anything great that existed then.

### How did they know it was the right one?

- Realized that there was a pretty big need from talking to other SaaS friends.
- Launched the first version in November 2013 and it was clear by February that
  there was a much larger opportunity. Focused 100% on it.

### What did it take to get the initial product out the door?

- Vanilla Rails app, hosted on Heroku, just one big monolithic app.
- Later spent a lot of money running background jobs so that he did not have to
  spend time on infrastructure!

### How did they get their first paying customers?

- Used Twitter connections to push for it, though he only had than 1k followers
  then.
- Start reaching out to random people he knew and they shared it.
- Sold to a $250/month customer in 8 days.
- Advised to have someone start using the product right away and try to have them
  pay for it, instead of getting stuck in the testing phase (building email list,
  building a landing page,...)
- Later wrote useful, educational content on the blog.
