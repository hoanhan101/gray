- Find happiness in your career:
  - Motivation theory - hygiene factors vs motivation factors:
    - Hygiene factors are status, compensation, job security, work condition, company policies,...
      - Bad hygiene causes dissatisfaction - low salary, poor condition,...
      - Improving the hygience factors of your job won't make you love it, instead just stop you from hating it.
    - Motivation factors are challenging work, recognition, responsibility, and personal growth.
      - Motivation is less about the external stimulation but more about what's inside of you and your work.
      - It's a job that truly meaningful to you, is challenging and intersting, allows you to grow professionally, provides you good oppoturnities,...
    - One of the easiest mistake is to focus on over-satisfy the hygiene factors over the motivation factors.
      - Better salaries, more prestigious title, nicer office are not gonna make you happy.
      - That said, ask yourself frequently:
        - Is this work meaningful to me?
        - Is this job going to give me a chance to develop?
        - Am I going to learn new things?
        - Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
        - Am I going to be given responsibility?
  - How to find a career that both motivates you and satisfies the hygiene factors?
    - Before taking a job, ask yourself what assumptions have to prove true for you to be happy.
      - Is this something that you enjoy doing?
      - What evidence do you have?
    - Find ways to to test these assumptions.
  - How to make sure you're heading in the right decision on a daily basis?
    - Look at how you manage your resources - time, energy, talent, wealth.
    - Prioritize on things that require long-term investment (building a good relationship with your family, building a business, raising a child,...)
      - It's often sad to see the same patterns happening over again in the personal lives of many ambituos people - though they believe that family is important, they actually allocate few resources for them.
- Find happiness in your relationships:
  - Relationships with family and close friends are one the greatest sources of happiness in life.
  - It needs CONSISTENT attention and care, though it's difficult because.
    - You'll be routinely tempted to invest your resources elsewhere that provide you a more immediate payoff.
    - Your family and friends rarely shout the loudest to demand your attention.
  - The clock of building a fulfilling relationship is ticking from the start.
  - Understand what's the most important to the other person by asking yourself "What job does one most need me to do?".
  - Children need to do more than learning new skills.
    - Allow them to be challenged, let them solve hard problems independently and develop values themselves.
    - Don't afraid to let them fail.
- Live a life of integrity (or stay out of jail):
  - Integrity requires constant self-awareness.
  - The best way to avoid the consequences of uncomfortable moral concessions is to never start making one in the first place.
