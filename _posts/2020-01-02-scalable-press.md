Efficient custom printing on demand.

100 millions a year.

### How did the founder come up with their idea? What was the context?

Had a friend, Raymond, working in the time T shirt business, Teespring, was booming. He also dropped out the same time, but because he had made 1 millions in revenue selling T shirts. Utilized cheap manufacturing, sold at 40% cheaper prices, were price leaders. Eric joined to build their own printing infrastructure to a even more automated, cheaper, efficient process.

Built the API first and posted in Hackernews. Went after T shirt business, found Teechip, competed with Teespring (YC). Expanded to other industry too based on the API.
