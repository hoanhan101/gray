## On Strength

Strength is built by tensing the muscles harder, not by exhausting them with reps. That said, to achieve high tension, you need high resistance and mental focus on contracting the muscle harder. Wight heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by the powerlifts such as bench press, squat, deadlift, and so on. However, without heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by:
- Redistributing your weight between your limbs: lifting your feet higher in a pushup focuses the weight more on your hands.
- Manipulating the range of motion: doing one-leg squat on a bench instead of a full squat.
- Training in an unstable environment: doing one-arm pushup or one-leg squat adds quite a lot of instability.
- Varying the leverage: hanging straight leg lift is much harder than a tucked leg lift.
- Minimizing bounce and momentum: doing dead-start one-arm pushup from the ground, or adding a long pause in between.

The tenser your muscles are, the more strength you will display and build.
