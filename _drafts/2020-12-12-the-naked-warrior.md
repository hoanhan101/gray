## Definitions

Strength is built by tensing the muscles harder, not by exhausting them with reps. Now, in order to achieve high tension, you need:
1. High resistance.
2. Mental focus on contracting the muscle harder.

You want to treat your training as a *practice* rather than a *workout*. 

### High resistance

With heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by the powerlifts such as bench press, squat, deadlift, and so on. However, without heavy weights, high resistance can be achieved by:
- Redistributing your weight between your limbs: lifting your feet higher in a pushup focuses the weight more on your hands.
- Manipulating the range of motion: doing one-leg squat on a bench instead of a full squat.
- Training in an unstable environment: doing one-arm pushup or one-leg squat adds quite a lot of instability.
- Varying the leverage: hanging straight leg lift is much harder than a tucked leg lift.
- Minimizing bounce and momentum: doing dead-start one-arm pushup from the ground, or adding a long pause in between.

### Mental focus

To better demonstrate how important mental focus is on contracting the muscle, let's look at different high-tension techniques for improving your strength instantly. The fact is, one of the most crucial skills in the performance of any strength athlete, whether it's a gymnast, a powerlifter, or an arm wrestler, is the ability to contract a muscle to stay tight. Whenever a muscle contracts, it irradiates a nerve force around it and increases the intensity of the neighboring musclesâ€™ contractions. 
1. Make a fist. Note that as you grip harder, the tension in your forearm overflows into your upperarm, even your shoulder. Now, try to do push up with a tight grip. You'll feel a lot stronger and be able to do more reps.
2. Feel your abs. Tensing your abs will amplify the intensity of the contraction of any muscle in your body. Martial art masters have been practiced this for years. This also explains why they are super strong even though they don't look as big as powerlifters'. Now, contract your abs flat and strong but no need to pull in or push out. Two good ways to practice doing so is to do the back-pressure crunch where you try to press your lower back down hard against the floor in a normal crunch position and act like you're about to get punched in the gut.
3. Strengthen your hips. Experienced fighters knows that real striking power is generated in the hips, rather than the knuckles. Now to strengthen your hips, contract your glutes by imagining pinching a coin with your cheeks.
4. Static stomp. Focus on applying maximum pressure to the deck with your foot when doing the pistol and with your palm when doing the one-arm pushup like you are stomping down. Feel the steady build-up of tension.
5. Tense your lats and keep your shoulders down while doing one-arm pushup, punch, and bench press. You want to push from the armpit, rather than the shoulder. This helps you put up heavier weight and suffer fewer shoulder injuries.
6. The corkscrew principle says that rotation, or spiral tension, increases the stability and power of almost any action. For a pushup, apply the inside-out corkscrew tension to the ground by twisting your arms while keeping your hands static.
