## Viral Marketing

Viral marketing is the process of getting your existing users to refer others to your product.
It can come from different forms:
- Pure word of mouth: people naturally tell people about your product.
- Inherent virality: people can only get value by inviting others (chat app, social media app).
- Collaboration: the product becomes more valuable when used collaboratively (Google Docs).
- Embedded communication from the product (Apple's "Sent from my iPhone").
- Incentive (refer friends to get more space on DropBox).
- Embedded buttons & widgets (Youtube's embedded videos, Facebook's Like button).
- Social networks.

## Public Relations (PR)

PR focus on getting coverage from traditional media like news, newspapers, magazines. Most make
money from ads, meaning the more view they have, the better. So if you have a compelling story,
they want to hear from you.

Top news get stories from smaller news or blogs. That said, to target these effectively, start small
and pitch to niche blogs or ones who often get picked up by larger ones like TechCrunch, Lifehacker,
Hacker News, Reddit, and so on.

Follow influencers in your industry and target blogs they often link to. Ask them for comment/feedback
on your product, and also to share it with their audience if possible.

Figure out specific reporters covering your market and build relationship with them (read their articles,
comment, offer help). Pitch when you have a compelling story (raising money, launching products, hitting
a usage barrier). Refer to the book for pitch templates.

## Unconventional PR

There are two types of unconventional PR:
- Publicly stunt: Richard Branson dressing like a woman, DuckDuckGo's billboard in Google's
backyard highlighting its privacy focus, Dollar Shave Club's viral video.
- Customer appreciation: sending gits, hand-written notes to customers, contests and giveaways,
having amazing customer support.

Unconventional PR is really effective if done right.

## Search Engine Marketing (SEM)

SEM refers to placing advertisements on search engine like Google. It's easy to get started
though difficult to master.

3 terminologies to focus on are
- Click-Through Rate (CTR): if 100 people see your ad, 3 click, your CTR is 3%. The higher
it is, the higher quality your ad is, the better placement and pricing you can have.
- Cost per Click (CPC): amount it costs to buy a click.
- Cost per Acquisition (CPA): amount it costs to acquire a customer. If your CPC is $1,
10% of people click your ad and *make a purchase*, your CPA is $1/10% = $10.

You can use SEM to test product positioning even before you build it.
