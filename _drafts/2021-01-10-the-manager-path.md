## Management 101

A good manager doens't just leave engineers alone entirely, meet twice every six month, and believes that they know what to work on. Instead, a good manager care about you as a person, actively work to help you grow in your career: give you valuable feedback, help navigate difficult situation, what you need to learn and improve, what to focus on. They want you to take their job someway.

One-one-one meetings serve 2 purposes. First, they create human connection between you and your manager. That doesn't meaning spending the whole time talking about your personal life but a few minute talking to know you as a human. The bedrock of strong team is human connection and trust. That requires the ability and willingness to be vulnerable in front of each other. Second, it's s opportunity to speak privately about whatever needs discussing: status of critical project, feedback, learning materials/pointers. You want feedback to improve. The sooner you know about your bad habits, the easier they are to correct. The sooner you let them know you're interested in getting promoted, the better idea of whether you're qualified, the more likely that they advocate for you and get it approved. Its' important to ask for specific areas to focus on to get that promotion.

To be better managed:
- Spend time thinking about what you want and where to improve.
- **Go after what you want, constantly ask for feedback, help, and advice. Asking for advice also shows respect and trust. When you want a raise or a promotion, ask for it.**
- Choose your managers wisely.

## Mentoring

The first act of people management for many engineers is mentoring someone. Let's start with mentoring an intern.
