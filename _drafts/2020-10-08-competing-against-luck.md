## Correlation vs causality

The masses of data that companies accumulated are not organized in a way that enables them to predict
which ideas will succeed. For examples, your height, age, shoe size, shopping habits,... don't
necessarily **cause** you to buy this or that product. There might be a correlation between some of
collected characteristics and the tendency of customers who purchase the same product but they don't
cause you to go and buy them. Correlation is not the same as causality.

## Job Theory

Instead of trying to find patterns and cross-references in the data sets of a product, it's better to
figure out what job function of it actually is. Essentially, when we buy a product, we hire it to get
a job done in a specific circumstance, to make the progress we were struggling to achieve. For example,
some people use Netflix because they want to be entertained, some use it to kill time, some use it
for educational purposes. Depending on the context and their unique circumstances, they hire Netflix
to do different jobs which might not match what Netflix creators make it to do.

That said, a job is defined as the progress that one is trying to make in a particular circumstance
(where you at, when it is, what you are doing, who you are with, and so on). However, not only does a job has
functional dimensions (what it does), it also has social and emotional dimensions. For example, the job
function could be to hire childcare because of your busy schedule, the emotional dimensions then depend
on who will you trust with your children.

**Job insights are more like stories and statistics.**

One helpful way to grasp a job is to go through this list of questions:
- What progress is the person trying to achieve? What are the functional, social, emotional dimensions?
- What are the circumstances? Who, when, where, while doing what?
- What obstacles are getting in the way?
- What have they tried so far? Are they use a workaround?
- What would a better solution mean for them? At what trade-offs?

**5 ways to search for unresolved jobs:**
- Look for jobs in your personal life: What are you struggling with?
- Find opportunity in people who are not hiring any product. This mean they can't find a solution that work for them so they give up.
- Pay attention to people to create their own solutions, workarounds.
- Look for what people don't want to do because they feel frustrating about the process or something.
- Spot unusual uses that are different from what your company has envisioned.
