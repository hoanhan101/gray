## Viral Marketing

Viral marketing is the process of getting your existing users to refer others to your product.
It can come from different forms:
- Pure word of mouth: people naturally tell people about your product.
- Inherent virality: people can only get value by inviting others (chat app, social media app).
- Collaboration: the product becomes more valuable when used collaboratively (Google Docs).
- Embedded communication from the product (Apple's "Sent from my iPhone").
- Incentive (refer friends to get more space on DropBox).
- Embedded buttons & widgets (Youtube's embedded videos, Facebook's Like button).
- Social networks.

## Public Relations (PR)

PR focus on getting coverage from traditional media like news, newspapers, magazines. Most make
money from ads, meaning the more view they have, the better. So if you have a compelling story,
they want to hear from you.

Top news get stories from smaller news or blogs. That said, to target these effectively, start small
and pitch to niche blogs or ones who often get picked up by larger ones like TechCrunch, Lifehacker,
Hacker News, Reddit, and so on.

Follow influencers in your industry and target blogs they often link to.

Figure out specific reporters covering your market and build relationship with them.

## Unconventional PR

There are two types of unconventional PR:
- Publicly stunt: Richard Branson dressing like a woman, DuckDuckGo's billboard in Google's
backyard highlighting its privacy focus, Dollar Shave Club's viral video.
- Customer appreciation: sending gits, hand-written notes to customers, contests and giveaways,
having amazing customer support.

Unconventional PR is really effective if done right.
