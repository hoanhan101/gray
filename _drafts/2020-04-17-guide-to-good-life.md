- What is a good life according to Stoicism?
  - Having a good life is not about making a good living, aka having a high-paying job since one could hate the job or have conflicting thoughts about its moral.
  - A person must be virtuous in order to have a good life.
    - A person's virtue depends on their excellence as a human being, how well one performs the function for which humans were designed.
      - A virtuous hammer is one that can drive nails well, a virtuous scissors is one that can cut well.
    - To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, that is to reason, to do certain things, to have certain duties. For example, one of which is the social duty that is to honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends,...
- Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good life:
  - Negative visualization:
    - Bad things happen, no matter how hard we try to prevent them. Assuming we will always be able to enjoy things we value causes us distress when they are taken from us.
    - We are unhappy largely because we're insatiable. After working hard for what we desire, we quickly get bored, dissatisfied, take things for granted and eventually chase new desire.
      - Consumer purchase: longing for a new TV, laptop, phone after buying one several weeks ago
      - Job: wanting higher pay, new workplace, new boss after landing the job of our dreams
      - Relationship: fantasizing about starting a new relationship after marriage
    - The solution is to forestall the adaptation process, even better reverse it so that we stop taking things for granted and desire what we already have.
      - Image that we have lost the things we value, our wife has left, our relatives and friends were death, we lost our job, our house, our money and so on.
      - As we go about our day, reflect periodically that we will not live forever and this day could be our last. The goal is not to change our activities but our state of mind that we carry out these activities and appreciate today.
    - Most of us are already living the dream, having a wonderful partner, a dream job, a good car though we take things for granted other than delighting in them. Some are less fortunate, still the practice of negative still can be applied.
  - Trichotomy of control:
    - There are things over which we have:
      - Complete control: goals we set for ourself, opinions and values we form
      - No control: whether the sun will rise tomorrow
      - Some but not complete control: whether we will win a competition or become a millionaire though we try really hard for it
    - If we want things that we have less or no control, we will sometimes fail to get what we want, be upset and anxious about it.
