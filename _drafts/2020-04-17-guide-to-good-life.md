- What is a good life according to Stoicism?
  - Having a good life is not about making a good living, aka having a high-paying job since one could hate the job or have conflicting thoughts about its moral.
  - A person must be virtuous in order to have a good life.
    - A person's virtue depends on their excellence as a human being, how well one performs the function for which humans were designed.
      - A virtuous hammer is one that can drive nails well, a virtuous scissors is one that can cut well.
    - To be virtuous is to live as we were designed to live, that is to reason, to do certain things, to have certain duties. For example, one of which is the social duty that is to honor our parents, be agreeable to our friends,...
- Psychological techniques to practice Stoicism for attaining a good life:
  - Negative visualization:
    - Bad things happen, no matter how hard we try to prevent them. Assuming we will always be able to enjoy things we value causes us distress when they are taken from us.
    - We are unhappy largely because we're insatiable. After working hard for what we desire, we quickly get bored, dissatisfied, take things for granted and eventually chase new desire.
      - Consumer purchase: longing for a new TV, laptop, phone after buying one several weeks ago
      - Job: wanting higher pay, new workplace, new boss after landing the job of our dreams
      - Relationship: fantasizing about starting a new relationship after marriage
    - The solution is to forestall the adaptation process, even better reverse it so that we stop taking things for granted and desire what we already have.
      - Image that we have lost the things we value, our wife has left, our relatives and friends were death, we lost our job, our house, our money and so on.
      - As we go about our day, reflect periodically that we will not live forever and this day could be our last. The goal is not to change our activities but our state of mind that we carry out these activities and appreciate today.
    - Most of us are already living the dream, having a wonderful partner, a dream job, a good car though we take things for granted other than delighting in them. Some are less fortunate, still the practice of negative still can be applied.
    - Being satisfied with what we've got doesn't mean we shouldn't seek certain things in life or strive to become better.
  - Trichotomy of control:
    - There are things over which we have:
      - Complete control: goals we set for ourself, opinions and values we form
      - No control: whether the sun will rise tomorrow
      - Some but not complete control: whether we will win a competition or become a millionaire though we try really hard for it
    - We should not concern ourselves with things that we have no control of.
    - If we want things that we have less or no control, we will sometimes fail to get what we want, be upset and anxious about it.
    - A strategy to deal with things that we have less or no control is to be careful about the goals and values that we form.
      - Instead of setting a goal to win a competition, which we only have partial control, set a goal to do our best in the match, which we have complete control.
      - We'll free ourself from frustration or disappointment if we lose.
  - Fatalism:
    - We must learn to welcome whatever comes to us and trust that it happens is for the best.
    - We have no control of the past as well as the present (this very moment). That said, we're wasting time worrying about past and present events.
    - Instead of wishing it could be different, embrace it.
  - Self-denial (extension of negative visualization):
    - Besides contemplating bad things happening, we should sometimes live as if they had happened, cause ourselves to experience discomfort that we could have avoided (experience cold weather even though clothes are at hand).
    - Benefits of voluntary discomfort:
      - Harden ourselves against misfortune that might happen in the future.
      - Grow confident that we can withstand major discomfort.
      - Help us appreciate what we have.
    - Besides practicing voluntary discomfort, we should sometimes forgo opportunities to experience pleasure, choose not to do things that make us feel good (eating carb and sugar).
    - Willpower is like muscle power: the more exercise, the stronger they are; the more will power we have, the more self-control and courage we have.
  - Meditation:
    - On the events of daily living at bedtime:
      - Did something disrupt our tranquility?
      - Did we experience anger/envy/lust?
      - Is there something that I could avoid?
    - On our Stoic progress:
      - Do we periodically engage in negative visualization?
      - Do we take time to distinguish between these things over which we have control, less and no control?
      - Are we careful to initialize our goals?
      - Have we refrained from dwelling on the past and instead focused our attention on the future?
      - Have we consciously practiced acts of self-denial?
