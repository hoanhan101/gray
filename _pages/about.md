## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my
free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, building and running personal ones.
- I built [Motion](https://motion.hoanhan.co/) to help people set goals they actually
follow using 4 simple strategies. More than 300 people signed up in the first week since
the launch in October 2020.
- I created [The Ultimate-Go Study Guide](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go) to help
people learn Go programming language better. The project now has over 13,000+ stars on GitHub
and also has an [eBook version](https://gumroad.com/l/bpUYF) that has sold over 3,000 copies
in the first month of August 2020.
- I shared my [101+ Coding Interview Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo) with 3,000+
subscribers on my [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/579f9d6927dd/hoanhanco) to help people prepare
better for their next coding interviews.

I also enjoy reading, writing about business, product development, decision making
and happiness. I believe that by self-educating on these topics, I am investing
a great deal in myself, my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships
that could help me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just
as important as mastering my technical craft.

If you're interested in getting updates on my latest insights, projects and
becoming a better software engineer as well as a better person overall, feel
free to join my [Insights mailing list here â†’](https://mailchi.mp/579f9d6927dd/hoanhanco)

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
