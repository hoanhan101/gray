## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my
free time, I enjoy teaching, writing, and contributing to open-source projects.
One of my most popular projects,
[Ultimate-Go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go), has 7,000+ stars on
Github. The other one, [101+ Coding Interview
Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo), attracts 2,000+ subscribers.

Other than spending time working on these technical projects, I also enjoy reading,
writing about business, happiness, health, work and life balance. I believe that by
self-educating on these topics, I am investing a great deal in myself,
my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships that could help
me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just as important
as mastering my engineering craft.

If you're interested in getting updates on my latest insights, projects and
becoming better a software engineer as well as a better person overall, feel
free to join my [Insights mailing list here â†’](https://tinyletter.com/hoanhan)

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
