## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my
free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, building and running personal ones.

Some of my popular projects include:
- [Motion](https://motion.hoanhan.co/): Simple way to set goal you actually follow
- [The Ultimate-Go Study Guide](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go): 13,000+ stars on GitHub
- [101+ Coding Interview Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo): 2,000+ subscribers

I also enjoy reading, writing about business, decision making
and happiness. I believe that by self-educating on these topics, I am investing
a great deal in myself, my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships
that could help me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just
as important as mastering my technical craft.

If you're interested in getting updates on my latest insights, projects and
becoming a better software engineer as well as a better person overall, feel
free to join my [Insights mailing list here →](https://mailchi.mp/579f9d6927dd/hoanhanco)

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
