## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my
free time, I enjoy teaching, writing, and contributing to open-source projects.
One of my most popular projects,
[Ultimate-Go](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go), has 7,000+ stars on
Github. The other one, [101+ Coding Interview
Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo), attracts 2,000+ subscribers.

I have been spending a lot of time working on these projects as well as
writing about tech and business. If you're interested in getting updates on my
latest insights, projects and becoming better a software engineer, feel free
to join my [Insights mailing list here â†’](https://tinyletter.com/hoanhan)

Lastly, ping me at [hoanhan101@gmail.com](mailto:hoanhan101@gmail.com) in case you
need anything.

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
