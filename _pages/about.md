## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, building and running personal ones.
- I created [The Ultimate-Go Study Guide](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go) to help people learn Go programming language better. The project now has over 14,000+ stars on GitHub and also has an [eBook version](https://gumroad.com/l/bpUYF) that has sold over 3,000 copies in the first month of August 2020. I'm working on publishing it on Amazon by 2021.
- I shared my [101+ Coding Interview Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo) with 3,000+ subscribers on my [newsletter](https://mailchi.mp/579f9d6927dd/hoanhanco) to help people prepare better for their next coding interviews.

The reason that I start this blog is to share what I learn on different topics of software engineering, product development, entrepreneurship, decision making, wealth and happiness. Or really, whatever I am curious about at the time. I believe that by self-educating on these topics, I am investing a great deal in myself, my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships that could help me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just as important as mastering my technical craft.

If you're interested in getting updates on my latest insights, projects and becoming a better software engineer as well as a better person overall, feel free to join my [Insights mailing list here â†’](https://mailchi.mp/579f9d6927dd/hoanhanco)

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
