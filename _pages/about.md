## About me

Hi friends,

I'm Hoanh, a software engineer with a background in distributed systems. In my
free time, I enjoy working on open-source and personal projects.

Some of my popular projects include:
- [Motion](https://motion.hoanhan.co/): Dead-simple goal & tracking app
- [The Ultimate-Go Study Guide](https://github.com/hoanhan101/ultimate-go): 13,000+ stars on GitHub
- [101+ Coding Interview Challenges](https://github.com/hoanhan101/algo): 2,000+ subscribers

Other than that, I also enjoy reading, writing about business, decision making
and happiness. I believe that by self-educating on these topics, I am investing
a great deal in myself, my knowledge onto the world, my hobbies, my relationships
that could help me live a more meaningful and fulfilling life. And this is just
as important as mastering my engineering craft.

If you're interested in getting updates on my latest insights, projects and
becoming a better software engineer as well as a better person overall, feel

Have a wonderful day,

Hoanh
